    I was able to add a writing function to write the Motherboard class to a file.
    I was not, however, able to get the program to read that file. 
    Also it still needs error handling for the fileio.

    It was not super difficult to add the writing function but I was having trouble getting it to read properly 
    without making large changes to the rest of the code. 

    The only suggestions for this code I would have is to separate the classes into separate files and maybe make the
    menu into a function also in another file.

    Some tests to run would be importing compatible Motherboard and CPU files and testing to see if they pass as 
    compatible. Then import incompatible files and see if they do not pass.
